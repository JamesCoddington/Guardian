# Testing

## About
This is the testing folder in which all testing files are located and used. When running the `test_startup.py` it will create two new files called `blacklist_log.csv` and `status.json`. The testing suite should run if those files are there or not.

Your Python installation may expose either a `python` or `python3` (`pip` or `pip3`) command. For simplicity, this guide will use `python`, but you should use the command that works with your machine.

## Windows

1. Make sure you are in the testing folder by running `cd testing`

2. To test the files run `python test_startup.py`

## Mac

1. Make sure you are in the testing folder by running `cd testing`

2. To test the files run `python test_startup.py`
