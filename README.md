# Guardian

**About** <br>
Guardian is an application that monitors the established connections found on the device, and decides whether to whitelist
or blacklist the application that is sending an established connection.<br> <br>
Whitelisted applications are saved within the status.json file. <br> <br>
Blacklisted applications are saved within the status.json file as well, but it is also written and logged into a csv file called "blacklist_log.csv". There it contains the unwanted application's name and file path.<br> <br>
